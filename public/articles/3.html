        <p class="subtitle">Career Struggles</p>
        <p>　I majored in music in high school, but in college, I studied trade and economics—fields completely unrelated to development. After graduating, I worked for two years as a planner and marketer, but I soon became disillusioned with the repetitive administrative tasks. During this time, I came across data analysis work by chance at my previous job, which piqued my interest and eventually led me to start learning programming. I quit my job, enrolled in a programming bootcamp, and after six months of training, I got a job as a data analyst. But ironically, becoming a data analyst only deepened my sense of confusion. Ultimately, I realized that data analysis was not the right fit for me.</p>
        <p>　<bold>1. Unclear Job Scope:</bold> Data analysis is a relatively new field, and as a result, job roles and responsibilities are often not clearly defined. There were many times when I was confused about what tasks I was supposed to focus on, especially as the boundaries</p>
        <p>　<bold>2. Repetitive Work:</bold> Data analysis tasks often follow a set pattern—data cleaning, basic analysis, and visualization. This repetitive nature made me feel that many of these tasks could easily be automated by AI or other tools. In fact, many data processing tasks are already handled by AI or automated systems, which led me to question the sustainability of this career path.
        <p>　<bold>3. Difficulty of Job Mobility:</bold>Companies hiring for data analysts tend to be large corporations with well-established data systems, so there are limited opportunities for job movement. This made it even more challenging to consider staying in this field long-term.</p>
        <p>　As I worked as a data analyst, I grew unsure whether this career was the right one for me. Although I briefly worked as a freelance marketer during my break, I found it incredibly uninteresting. Then, my younger sibling, who had been interested in coding from a young age, suggested that we build an app together. Strangely enough, I found it incredibly exciting. For the first time in a long while, I was focused and lost track of time. Although the app project ended in failure due to poor design and sibling arguments (note to self: never work with family...), it was a turning point for me. I realized that programming, where you can immediately see the result of your work, was something I truly enjoyed. This experience led me to seriously consider switching to a career in web development or app development.</p>
        <p>　</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Why I Want to Become a Developer</p>
        <p>　First, Expertise. When I was in the UK, I was shocked to see a friend of mine, the same age as me, getting job offers from local companies. I had been more proactive in my job search, and my English was better, yet I was begging for a job, while my developer friend was being sought out by headhunters. Although I already knew the importance of technical skills, seeing this firsthand in a foreign country made me realize even more how vital they are.</p>
        <p>　If given the opportunity, I would love to work overseas, but I don’t have the artistic talent to be a designer, nor the intelligence or sacrifice to be a nurse. While I’m not fluent enough in English to communicate like a native speaker, the one technical advantage I can offer is development. Thankfully, I’ve always enjoyed creating things on computers, and my natural curiosity and self-driven nature align well with programming. This made my decision to transition into a career in development much easier.</p>
        <p>　Second, Possibilities. One of the biggest attractions of being a developer is the ability to turn imagination into reality. The idea of creating something from scratch and bringing it to life is what makes programming so exciting. Programming also offers the opportunity to take on a wide range of challenges, and even if you fail, those failures become part of the learning process.</p>
        <p>　Since I was young, I’ve admired entrepreneurs and imagined becoming one myself. The reason I shifted from studying music to economics was partly driven by my desire to eventually start my own business. Even during my unemployed period after quitting my job, I occasionally tried my hand at online businesses. However, simply selling someone else’s products with a price mark-up didn’t spark my interest. My ultimate goal is to create a full-fledged service as a developer, launch it, and build a business around it.</p>
        <p>　</p>
        <p class="subtitle">What I’ve Learned at the End of Wandering</p>
        <p>　One thing I’ve learned from my twenties is this: I grow the most when I set goals, challenge myself, and achieve them. That’s when I feel the most fulfilled and find life exciting. Conversely, when I don’t have any goals, especially when I’m unsure about my direction, I feel helpless and bored. In this sense, the constant challenges and opportunities to turn new ideas into businesses in development provide great motivation for me.</p>
        <p>　The truth is, I’m not yet sure whether I’ll become a developer. But as always, the certainty might not come immediately. What I’m sure of is that if something calls to me, I should try it. I’d rather try and fail than regret not attempting it.</p>
        <p>　One thing I am certain about is that I will likely continue programming for the rest of my life. Whether it’s as a career, a side job, or a hobby, my goal is to be a cool grandmother programming at the age of 70 in the 100-year life era. (Sounds pretty cool...)</p>
        <p>　</p>
        <p>　Some people say my constant self-reflection and wandering are a waste of time. But I believe that living a life without knowing who you are or whether you’re headed in the right direction is the real waste of time. Living in such a way means that someone else is leading your life, and at some point, you’ll feel empty. What truly matters is getting to know yourself, trusting yourself, and doing the work you need to do today. That’s why I continuously asked myself whether the direction I’m heading is truly right.</p>
        <p>　So, if there are others like me who are struggling later in life, I want to say that this is a sign you are living your life right by constantly questioning yourself. (Honestly, I’m saying this to myself... haha) In the end, no one will worry as much about my struggles as I do. My wandering and pondering are a privilege and a right I hold in my own life.</p>
        <p>　</p>
