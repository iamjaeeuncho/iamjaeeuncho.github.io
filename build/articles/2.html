        <p class="subtitle">A Failed Student in Music</p>
        <p>　I was in the final stages of my "middle school syndrome" when I entered high school, thinking I could pursue a career in music simply because I liked it and was confident in my abilities. However, my time at the music school, which I imagined would be full of excitement, strangely made me uncomfortable. It felt like I was wearing a piece of clothing that didn’t fit me, and I felt out of place. After about two years, I realized that I didn’t have the talent to make a living from music. But at that point, I wasn’t sure what I should do. Then my homeroom teacher recommended that I participate in an entrepreneurship camp, and that was where I first became interested in business and management.</p>
        <p>　</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Economics Student</p>
        <p>　I started preparing for the college entrance exam late and got into the International Trade Department at Kookmin University. Back then, I didn't know much about the school, but I happened to apply there for a reason as simple as being located in Seoul. When I visited the campus, I immediately fell in love with it. The fresh air from Bukak Mountain and the cozy campus left a lasting impression on me. After my interview, I spent a long time sitting on a bench, telling myself that I really wanted to attend this school so much so that I even dreamt about it.</p>
        <p>　After hoping to be accepted, I was unfortunately rejected from the school’s early admission program. However, I imagined myself walking around the campus every day as I studied for the regular college entrance exam, and I applied again and was accepted. At that time, the book "The Secret," which was about how our thoughts shape our reality, was popular, and I truly understood how powerful thoughts can be.</p>
        <p>　College life was great. I met many people, had a variety of experiences, and felt like my world was expanding in a positive direction. Economics was also incredibly fun. Although my grades weren’t high, I still enjoyed the simple, humble college life with a B average.</p>
        <p>　One of the most exciting things for me was learning economic theories that explained the causes, effects, and results of social issues, which I had always wondered about. It felt like I was finally solving the problems I had always struggled with. Looking back, I believe that studying economics in college was one of the best decisions of my life.</p>
        <p>　</p>  
        <p class="subtitle">Two Years of Wandering</p>
        <p>　I tend to be impulsive and quick to act once I make a decision. But in my early 20s, I didn’t know what to do and ended up wasting time, unable to take action. So, before my senior year, I took a leave of absence. When I wasn’t attending school every day as a matter of duty, I felt lost. The thought of leaving the school environment made me worry about what I would do with my life.</p>
        <p>　I went through a tough period after experiencing a personal crisis that left me in a slump for about six months. I was filled with a sense of defeat, feeling like I couldn’t do anything. Eventually, I realized that nothing would change unless I took action myself. I had hoped someone would pull me out of my despair, but I realized that I was the only one who could end it.</p>
        <p>　I decided not to waste any more time and started by doing small things. I began going outside every day, exercising, and studying for certifications. These small successes helped me take on challenges such as a cross-country trek, a volunteer position at a presidential campaign, travel through South Korea, and various volunteer work overseas.</p>
        <p>　Ironically, even though that time was the most difficult of my 20s, it also helped me mature. I had always been someone who avoided problems, but as I took responsibility for my choices in my 20s, it was inevitable that I would face struggles. During this period, I also learned that not everything could be achieved by effort alone, and I became more at ease with failure.</p>
        <p>　</p>        
        <p class="subtitle">From Philippines to Myanmar</p>
        <p>　The most fulfilling part of those two years of wandering was volunteering. It gave me a sense of purpose and helped me realize that I could be useful, especially when I had been feeling worthless. (That’s why I often recommend volunteering to friends who are struggling with slumps and depression!) Toward the end of my leave of absence, I was fortunate enough to be sponsored by a company for a two-month language course in Angeles City, Philippines.</p>
        <p>　At 23, the Philippines was my first trip abroad. Having never been outside of Korea, I initially thought of the Philippines as a postcard-perfect vacation destination with clear seas and warm sun. But the reality was far different. I was staying in Angeles, known for its red-light district. The place was filled with young girls in heavy makeup trying to entice older men, and the atmosphere was unsettling. I constantly felt on edge, fearing for my safety.</p>
        <p>　After about three weeks, I ventured out and stumbled upon a landfill. The smell was overwhelming, and I saw children playing on the piles of trash, seemingly happy despite the environment. It was an eye-opening moment for me. I realized that this area was a slum, home to the most destitute people. The sight of these children and their tragic lives sparked my interest in international development, and eventually, it led me to an internship in Myanmar after graduation.</p>

        </div>
        <p>　However, my idealistic views about international development were shattered by the passive and conservative corporate culture, and by unethical behavior among some of the employees. I became disillusioned with the system and struggled with the exploitation of young people’s idealism for the benefit of organizations. The conditions in the NGO and among volunteers were harsh, and I questioned whether I could dedicate my life to such sacrifices.</p>
        <p>　Seeing the exploitation of well-meaning individuals who were trying to change the world made me angry. I realized that, culturally, in Korea, volunteers are often not respected, and I felt sorry for those who were not being properly treated despite their sacrifices.</p>
        <p>　</p>        
        <p class="subtitle">Working Holiday in the UK for 2 Years</p>
        <p>　A month before finishing my internship in Myanmar, I started searching for job opportunities and came across a notice about the UK working holiday program. I wasn’t thinking about going to the UK, nor did I have the money to do so, but I remembered giving up on the Canadian working holiday program before and decided to apply.</p>
        <p>　I applied with no expectations, even having a friend submit the documents for me. When I received an acceptance letter, I was initially reluctant to go. At 26, I felt that I should be seeking stability in my life and career, and I saw a two-year gap as wasted time.</p>
        <p>　However, I didn’t want to waste the visa, so I decided to go to the UK with the mindset that I would travel and return if I couldn’t find a job. I spent around 1,667 USD on the visa and used 250 USD from my internship savings and 250 USD in loans to fund my trip. I had three months to make it work in the UK.</p>
        <p>　Arriving in London, I was more scared than excited. I cried at the airport, terrified of going to a foreign country and taking full responsibility for my life. The first two weeks were chaotic as I tried to find housing, and then I focused on improving my English and securing a job.</p>
        <p>　I initially wanted to work in international trade, my major, so I applied to Korean companies in the UK. Some offered unpaid internships, and others suggested extremely low salaries. I was appalled by how Korean companies undervalue their workers. After two months of looking, I was finally hired by a company with a modest salary. Although I had no relevant experience, the employees were kind and the work was interesting, so I decided to stay. This job helped me grow both professionally and personally.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Returning to Korea in 2018</p>
        <p>　In March 2018, I returned to Korea after finishing my two-year working holiday in the UK. On my way back, I used my last month’s salary to fulfill a bucket list item—taking the Trans-Siberian Railway from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok. The journey was more boring than I had expected, and I realized that travel no longer holds the same allure for me.</p>

        </div>
        <p>　Having lived abroad, I now see that life in foreign countries is not all that different from life in Korea. There are challenges everywhere, and after hearing stories of people who gave up their life abroad to return to Korea, I finally understood why they made that choice. My friends joke about my "national pride," but Korea is truly a great place to live.</p>
        <p>　Now, as I look back on my 20s, I feel like I’ve experienced everything I wanted to, even though I don’t have much money, a job, or assets. But I don’t have any regrets. My 30s will surely be more challenging, but as my mom always says, "If you’re not going to die, just live with it."</p>
