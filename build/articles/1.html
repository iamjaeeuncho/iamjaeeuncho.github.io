        <p>　At the age of 23, I flew on an airplane for the first time in my life. It was a one-hour flight to Jeju Island in South Korea. Then, six months later, I got my first passport and went overseas for the first time. It was a two-month language study program in the Philippines. Nowadays, overseas travel is common, but back then, traveling abroad was a huge dream for me, something that required a lot of courage. I had a romanticized idea of foreign countries, which led me to major in International Business (also known as Trade) in university, but it still took me three years to finally go abroad.</p>
        <p>　</p>
        <p class="subtitle">I wrote 'job seeker,' but I meant 'unemployed'.</p>
        <p>　I graduated from college. I had procrastinated for two years because I wanted to delay it as long as possible, but I couldn't avoid becoming a member of society forever. When people asked what I was doing, I answered "job seeker," but in reality, I was just a lazy unemployed person. After graduation, I wrote cover letters like everyone else and went to interviews at a few companies. Despite my TOEIC score being only 700, I still applied for overseas internships.</p>
        <p>　Then, my first cover letter got accepted, and I passed the interview, so I started an internship. Just when I thought it had been too easy, the internship got canceled. The company that had been exploiting workers under the pretext of training had their internship canceled by a public institution that had matched me with the company. Even so, I stubbornly pushed forward, thinking that this was my only chance. The desperation of being a job seeker seemed to have turned me into my own slave.</p>
        <p>　</p>
        <p class="subtitle">I Finally Went to Myanmar and Started My First Job.</p>
        <p>　It seems like it was fate that I eventually went. The internship in Myanmar that had been canceled due to the company's attempt to exploit a newbie like me. After that, I spent some time thinking, "Was I really that foolish?" But I kept telling myself that I still wanted to work abroad and continued to apply for international internships. Eventually, I was selected for an internship with a public corporation and was sent to Myanmar again.</p>
        <p>　I had the option to choose my country, and because I still had regrets about not going to Myanmar earlier, I chose it as my top priority. Before that, I had no idea where Myanmar was, but after the internship was canceled, I became determined to go. Later, I learned that not many people chose Myanmar as their first choice, so I was told that as soon as I passed, my internship in Myanmar was confirmed.</p>
        <p>　The moment I landed at the airport, the unique smell of Myanmar hit me. The Indian-like scent and the unexpectedly cool yet humid evening air of Yangon made me realize that I had arrived in a foreign country. This was the beginning of my life in Myanmar. It was my first time working in a company, and everything was confusing, but it was always the work I had dreamed of related to international development, so I felt incredibly happy. I felt like I had become someone who could make a significant positive change in the world.</p>
        <p>　However, the work wasn’t easy. Everything was new to me, from writing simple drafts to reporting to my supervisor. Everything made me nervous and scared. But because I was a newly graduated intern, the company didn’t expect much from me, so I managed to get by.</p>
        <p>　Fortunately, the work itself became easier with time. The more rigid and conservative company culture was tougher for me. But with the support and encouragement of great fellow interns and the expert professionals sent by the company, I was able to overcome it. I've always thought that I am truly fortunate to have good people around me. I have so much to be grateful for in life.</p>
        <p>　</p>
        <p class="subtitle">What if I Ended Up Paralyzed?</p>
        <p>　My internship went on fairly smoothly, though challenging. A month before my internship ended, I went on a short trip with a fellow intern to Hpa-An in Myanmar. Hpa-An isn’t a very developed area compared to others, but it is famous for its clean nature. As promised, the natural scenery was incredibly beautiful, and I had a mystical feeling. The rugged mountains and crystal-clear lakes truly made me think that if gods existed, they would live in a place like this.</p>
        <p>　The trip, however, turned out to be strange from the beginning to the end, almost as if I was possessed by a spirit. But it was only at the very end of the trip when things went wrong. I had a fall accident. I slipped while dipping my feet into a small stream and fell backward, hitting my lower back on a stone step. In that instant, my lower body felt incredibly heavy. The pain was intense, and I sat there for a long time, wondering if I could move. I tried hard to move my toes, but there was no movement at all. To make things worse, even the slightest movement, like coughing or speaking, caused unbearable pain in the muscles of my lower body.</p>
        <p>　I managed to get through a seven-hour night bus ride back to Yangon while enduring the pain. I prayed desperately, hoping that when I woke up the next morning, the pain would be gone. But the next day, it was just as bad. I eventually went to the hospital.</p>
        <p>　Luckily, there was no fracture or nerve damage. The doctor said that I should rest a little, and it would get better, but the pain was unbearable. I couldn't sleep without painkillers, and every morning at 4 a.m., I would wake up, take my medicine, and fall back asleep. I had to use my vacation days to just lie in bed for a few days. But my condition didn’t improve, and I began to fear that I might be seriously ill, so I was transferred to a large hospital in Thailand. Even after weeks, the cause of the pain remained unknown, and I ended up having an EEG, but everything appeared normal. Meanwhile, the medical bills were over 2,500 USD. In the end, I returned to Korea and received treatment. After nearly a month of lying in bed, the pain was still there, but at least I could move around more easily.</p>
        <p>　That time made me realize that my health is not something to be taken for granted. Humans are fragile. I could have easily ended up disabled or even dead because of a single mistake. It made me humbly reflect on life. The feeling that our health, which we take for granted, is actually a gift from God, as a nun once told me, flashed through my mind.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">　</p>
        <p>　In my twenties, I was a person with many rough edges. Some might have called it passion, but in reality, I was full of desire yet lazy, and I often lived by judging the world, thinking I was better than others. I hadn’t faced many challenges, so I didn’t experience many failures, which made me more prone to being discouraged by small setbacks. But looking back now, especially after experiencing pain, I realize that all of this was part of my process of growing and becoming stronger.</p>
        <p>　When I think about it, life is much like a game. Just like characters in a game level up by completing quests and gaining experience, humans too must overcome challenges and hardships to grow. So, the more challenges and adversities you face, the bigger and stronger you become. This truth always seems to be valid. In that sense, my internship in Myanmar was an experience that broadened my perspective on life. It made me realize how fortunate I am just to live safely. Although it was frustrating, looking back, life is mysterious, unpredictable, and fun.</p>
