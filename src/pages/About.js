            <p>I always keep this line in my mind: 'Life is short and only happens once.' So, I would describe myself as a person who strives to do as many diverse things as possible, all the time.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, in my 20s, I challenged myself with as many things as I could, but sometimes I failed. However, those unintended failures sparked my curiosity in unfamiliar areas and helped me discover new possibilities. Becoming a programmer, after working as an NGO worker, a marketer, and a data analyst, was also a result of those failures.</p>
            <p>My style is to try and fail rather than regret not trying. However, this time is a bit different because, after experiencing programming over the past year, I've found it more enjoyable and have felt more alive than ever before.</p>
            <p>I hope this writing provides an answer to those who may wonder, 'Why has she kept changing careers?' I‚Äôll conclude the piece here. ü§≠ </p>
