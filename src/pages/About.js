            <p>I always keep this line in my mind: 'Life is short and only happens once.' This mindset drives me to explore a wide range of opportunities and experiences.</p>
            <p>In my 20s, I threw myself into various fields, challenging myself to try new things. Some of those attempts resulted in failure, but rather than discouraging me, they sparked my curiosity in unfamiliar areas and helped me uncover new possibilities. Transitioning into programming, after working as an NGO worker, a marketer, and a data analyst, is a testament to how these diverse experiences shaped my career path.</p>
            <p>Over the past year, I‚Äôve found programming to be an incredibly enjoyable and fulfilling pursuit, making me feel more alive than ever before. I am continually learning new technologies and approaches, which excites me about the endless opportunities for growth and contribution in the tech industry.</p>
            <p>I look forward to using my diverse background and passion for problem-solving to create meaningful, innovative solutions as I continue to develop my skills as a programmer.</p>
